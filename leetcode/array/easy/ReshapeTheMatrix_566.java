/**
 * 566. Reshape the Matrix
 *
 * In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.
 *
 * You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.
 *
 * The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
 *
 * If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.
